Within recent years, museums and online art collectives around the world have started to digitize their art collections. In order to help support educators, curators, and archivists to archive and find interesting correlations between artwork, I helped to design a deep learning model.
        A database was formed with over 15,000 web-scraped images, each having attributes like (e.g. date and artistic style). A total 12 total artistic styles and 28 artists were represented. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to predict style and artist, with a validation classification accuracy of 40% for style and 53% for artists. A simple visual interface was made to allow a user to run new (untrained) images through the model.
        The research was conducted under the guidance and mentorship of Dr. Serre from the Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences  (CLPS) lab at Brown University.
